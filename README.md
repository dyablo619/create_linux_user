# create_linux_user
I created this basic script to allow you to create a new Linux user by entering the username, password, and permission level. I'm always creating new users and wanted to come up with a quick way to automate it, so I created this script. The script creates the user profile in the system and creates the home directory, the .ssh directory, and the file authorized_keys. 

You are more than welcome to use this as you wish and modify it if you wish; of course, it is always suggested to reference the author, but not required.
